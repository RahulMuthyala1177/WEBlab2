        <div class="subtext" id="main">
            <p> The name's Rahul. I'm a 22-year-old South Asian design student with a tech sort of background and a lot to say about the trends and direction of the contemporary design world.</p>
            <p>I wanted to be an engineer for most of my life. By the time I changed my mind about that, my liaison with the information technology had drastically altered my worldview already. This still informs much of my work and work ethic - design is no less
                of a science in my eyes than physics or computing.</p>

            FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM : <br>
•	Computer algorithms to pick out specific, distinctive details about a person’s face. These details such as the distance between the eyes\shapes of the chin, are then converted into a mathematical representation and compared to data on other faces collected in a face recognition database.<br>
•	Software used: Matlab. <br>
<br>
BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION : <br>
•	As Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, the price volatility issue should be handled within a short period. The process of prediction starts from collecting data to forecasting bitcoin prices.<br>
•	The proposed methodology considers two different LSTM and XGBOOST-based prediction models to forecast the daily price of bitcoin by identifying and evaluating relevant features by the model itself. <br>
<br>
HEATING AND COOLING SUIT WITH LOCATION DETECTION : <br>
•	The project aims to provide personalized thermal comfort based on the user's environment. It utilizes sensors to detect the user's location, temperature, and humidity. The suit then adjusts its heating or cooling elements accordingly, ensuring optimal comfort for the wearer.
